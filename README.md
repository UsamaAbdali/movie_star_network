Hollywood Movie Star Network

This project was a collaboration between Arnesh Dawar, Aggrim Arora, Manpreet Saini and Usama Abdali.

The purpose of this project was to construct & analyze a network from a dataset found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) which contains information regarding 45000 movies and their cast members, user reviews and other such metadata scraped from IMDB and other databases.

Once the network was constructed, various community detection, centrality, and link prediction algorithms were used & the results were recorded and further discussed in a report.
